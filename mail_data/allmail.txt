Hello People

This is a gentle reminder for the open meet scheduled today. Pragati is introducing an open discussion on the structure of flipped classrooms in IIT-K, the MOOC system as a whole and the future of this system within the student population.

We shall be covering faculty and student perspectives on the issue, and analyzing the official report regarding this new programme. Since this is an innovation which is visible and new, and might just become pervasive in the years to come, it becomes imperative for us to talk about it.

Also intersecting with our dialogue today will be an understanding of what constitutes education, and how different perspectives on education can be implemented within the same innovative framework.

Be a part of this dialogue tonight:

From: 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m
At: FMC Room, New SAC
[On: November 6, 2016 (Sunday)]

The poster for the event can be found in the drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5TsMOlu0qa8OXRxNk1nSjBVTmRlMFJfTGJ5MlhLY2QyMGY0/view?usp=sharing

Dear All,
"The Gandhi Fellowship" is a unique 2- year residential Professional Program in Transformation Leadership for Social Entrepreneurs. It prepares Fellows to take on leadership roles as entrepreneurs through a process of imbibing and imparting change management. The Fellow is enrolled for these 2 years in a contract with PFEL to work in the education sector with government primary, upper primary and secondary schools and interact and intervene on a regular basis with Government officials under the Education Ministry and other allied departments of the government. The Fellow is given a certain number of schools in our operating states, to impact and turn around especially in the areas of quality of education and change leadership in the Headmaster's role. His Innovation skills and ability to Influence without Authority are the key requisites in his leadership style which go on to help him achieve his tasks successfully. Daily coordination, through understanding of the systems at the school level and establishing the required associations with the Government bodies, bridging gaps and motivating the schools towards better and effective teaching methods with the support of innovative pedagogy designs are some of the tasks that the Fellow is engaged and involved in. Soon the Headmaster and the related government bodies become his partners towards a common mission and that is to achieve the status of a model school.
